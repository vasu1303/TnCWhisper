Google One – Terms of ServiceGoogle One Additional Terms of ServiceEffective: 9 November 2021 |Archived versionsTo use and access Google One, whether you are the Google One plan manager, are part of a family group sharing Google One or are a non-member user, you must accept (1) the Google Terms of Service and (2) these Google One Additional Terms of Service (the Google One Additional Terms).Please read each of these documents carefully. Together, these documents are known as the Terms. They establish what you can expect from us as you use our services, and what we expect from you.Except for Google One customers in France, if these Google One Additional Terms conflict with the Google Terms of Service, these Additional Terms will govern for Google One.Although it's not a part of these Terms, we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information.1. General description of Google OneGoogle One is made available by Google to provide you with a destination for Google services and support, provide rewards and offers, and discover new features and products. Google One features may include paid storage plans shared across Google Drive, Google Photos and Gmail, customer support for certain Google products, family sharing features, mobile backup and restore, and other benefits provided to you by Google or via third parties. Your use of additional Google products or services is governed by the terms of service applicable to such products or services. Some products, features and benefits may not be available in all countries. Please visit the Google One Help Centre for more information.2. Paid accounts – Payment, subscription and refundsPayments. Only Google One plan managers may purchase, upgrade, downgrade or cancel a Google One membership. Google accepts payment through a Google Payments account or any other form of payment indicated prior to purchase.Subscription cancellations. Google Payments will automatically take payment from the date that you sign up for a Google One membership, and your subscription to Google One will renew automatically until it is cancelled. You may cancel at any time. If you cancel your subscription, you will retain access to Google One for the remaining term of your existing subscription. If, in addition, you elect to delete Google One via service deletion, you agree that you may lose access to Google One services and functionality immediately, without a refund for the remaining term of your existing subscription. If you prefer to retain Google One services for the term of your subscription, please cancel your subscription rather than deleting Google One.Right of withdrawal. If you are in the EU or the UK, you have the right to cancel within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading or renewing your Google One membership without giving any reason. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must communicate your decision to withdraw by an unequivocal statement to the provider from which you made the purchase.Refunds. For additional rights of refund, please refer to the relevant policy from Google Play or the provider from which you made the purchase. If you purchased from Google, no refunds or partial billing periods are available, except as required by applicable law. If you purchased from somewhere other than Google, such as using your iPhone or iPad, or you signed up for a Google One membership via the App Store or other third-party provider, the provider's refund policy will apply. You'll need to get in touch with that third party (e.g. Apple support) to request a refund.Changes to pricing. We may change the Google One price(s) in effect, but will give you prior notice of these changes. These changes will apply after your current payment period is complete, when the next payment is due from you after the notice. We will give you at least 30 days' prior notice of a price increase before you are charged. If you are given less than 30 days' prior notice, the change will not apply until the payment after the next payment is due. If you do not wish to continue with Google One at the new price, you may cancel or downgrade at any time from within your Google Play, Apple or third-party subscription settings. Your cancellation or downgrade will apply to the next billing period after the current service term, unless otherwise set out in the applicable payment platform terms. Where the price increases and consent is required, your subscription may be cancelled unless you agree to the new price. If your subscription is cancelled and you later decide to resubscribe, you will be charged at the then-current subscription rate.3. Customer supportGoogle One provides you with access to customer support across a number of Google products and services ('Customer Support'). In the event that Customer Support is unable to assist you with your support request, we may transfer or redirect you to the Customer Support service of the Google product in question. This includes instances in which Google One does not provide Customer Support for the specific Google product or service being requested. If your Google One subscription is cancelled or suspended, your unresolved Customer Support issues may also be suspended and you may need to submit a new enquiry once you have reinstated your subscription.4.
